### Given a number in form of string to you.Note that the length of this string can be very large out of the range of long long int also 
Now How can you create a number which 
* contains all the digits of the given number N (i.e it is some permutations of the digits N) 
* Also it is just greater than the number N (i.e smallest almong all the largest possible number possible)

#### A simple Brute Force approach will involve creating all th combinations of the given sequence of number (You can use recurssion for that) and choose the nnumber which is minimum of all the number greater than N 
Time Complexity of the above approach will be O(n!)
