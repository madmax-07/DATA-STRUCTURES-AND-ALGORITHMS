/*The structure of linked list is the following

struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

/* 
Approach
basically we have to delete the current node if it has any greater node towards its right
* (Not just towards it immediate right but all of the right side)
i/p: 14->3->7->6->12->10
o/p: 14->12->10 
[ 3 has 7,6,12 10 
  7 has 12,10 
  6 has 12
 ]
traverse the list from the start and delete the node when the current Node < next Node. To delete the current node, follow this approach. 

Let us assume you have to delete current node X 

1. Copy next nodeâ€™s data into X i.e X.data = X.next.data

2. Copy next nodeâ€™s next address i.e X.next = X.next.next;

Move forward in the List only when the current Node is > the next Node.
 To check for current towrads it right I will recursivelly solve the problem 
 10->12->13->14->15
 10->(12->13->14->15)
 12->(13->14->15)
 13->(14->15)
 14->(15)
 15
