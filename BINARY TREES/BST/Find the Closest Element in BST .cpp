/*question link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-closest-element-in-bst/1
Approach :
A brute force solution for this problem is to do a postorder traversal of a binary search tree and take absolute difference of each element find the node having minimum absolute difference with given target value K in linear time.

An efficient solution for this problem is to take advantage of characteristics of BST. Here is the algorithm to solve this problem :

If target value K is present in given BST, then itâ€™s the node having minimum absolute difference.
If target value K is less than the value of current node then move to the left child.
If target value K is greater than the value of current node then move to the right child.
basically hume diffrence (val-K) ki value minimise karne h that means ki dono numbers a and b should be approaching/close to each other
